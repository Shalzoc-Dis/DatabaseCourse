# DatabaseCourse
This repository is essentially a notebook I kept while following a course on databases.

The course has been developed by Keerti Purswani and can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPqazMTzNOM. 

You may not use the code in this repository. Please give the course a view instead.
